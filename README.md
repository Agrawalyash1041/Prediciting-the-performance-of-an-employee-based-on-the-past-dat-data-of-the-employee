# Problem Statement
Teach for India a NPO was seeking to address perfromance problem by predicting employee performance and implementing learning and development measures to improve the skills of their 28000+ fellows.

# Data Description
The Data is Split between two datasets i.e. Train and Test Data. Further the Data can be described as :-

# Tasks Performed 
I have carried out tasks like Data Preprocessing , Data Visualization , Feature Engineering , Balancing the Target Column , Data Scalling using various scallers to make the Data Model ready.

# Models Used 
After Data Preprocessing i have Scalled the data using Standard Scaller and then build the model using XGboost Algorithm to get the highest possible accuracy and highest AUC which is 93% and 0.98 respectively.

# Prerequisites 
One should have good knowledge in python and good understanding of Machine Learning algorithms.
